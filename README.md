🌦️ Introducing My Weather Web Page! 🌦️
I’m excited to share my latest project: a web page that fetches and displays weather data using a weather API. This tool allows users to view current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information based on their location or a location they input.
Key Features:
🔹 Location-Based Weather: Fetches weather data based on the user's location or a location provided by the user.
🔹 Current Conditions Display: Shows up-to-date weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and weather descriptions.
🔹 User-Friendly Interface: Designed with an intuitive layout for easy navigation and interaction.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Structures the web page and forms.
CSS: Styles the page for a clean and attractive look.
JavaScript​: Implements API calls to fetch weather data and dynamically updates the page content.
A special thanks to Prodigy InfoTech for giving me this opportunity! Your support and guidance have been instrumental in developing this project.
